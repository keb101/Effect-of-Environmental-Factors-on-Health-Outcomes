Environmental Factors vs. Health Outcomes
==============================

There is a push in the U.S. to address environmental injustices. Overburdened communities are defined as “minority, low-income, tribal, or indigenous populations or geographic locations in the United States that potentially experience disproportionate environmental harms and risks.” To determine which are the most pressing environmental problems, the harm from particular environmental problems should be quantified in terms of health effects.  
 
The goal of this research was to predict specific negative health outcomes: asthma prevalence, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke from a variety of environmental factors. This prediction would allow these outcomes to be linked to specific environmental factors in overburdened communities.  
 
The dataset with the eleven environmental indicators came from the EJScreen [environmental justice screen] 2020 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The abbreviations for these indicators are defined in the appendix. The data on the health outcomes were obtained from U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention’s Local Data for Better Health 2022, which is based on 2020 information.
